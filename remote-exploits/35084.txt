Vulnerability Description:

==============================

A unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was found in the

from a known issue in struts, CVE-2010-1870, that allows for code execution
via OGNL Injection. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable
in both the Windows and Linux version of the software and has existed in the
LISTSERV Maestro software since at least version 8.1-5.  As a result, a
specially crafted HTTP request can be constructed that executes code in the
context of the web application. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not
require authentication and can lead to root level privilege on any system
running the LISTServ Maestro services.
