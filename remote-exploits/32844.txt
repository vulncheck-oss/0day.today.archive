~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote is a wireless presenter using
2.4 GHz radio communication.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows [1]:

"Brilliant red laser pointer helps you get their attention - and keep
it."

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless
presenter Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote is prone to keystroke
injection attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the wireless presenter Logitech R700 Laser
Presentation Remote is vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data packets
of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless presenter to the
receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used protocol. By knowing
the used data protocol, it is possible to inject packets in the data
communication that are actually interpreted as keystrokes by the
receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of
a Logitech R700 wireless presenter. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
the wireless presenter Logitech R700 Laser Presentation Remote using an
in-house developed software tool in combination with the USB radio
dongle Crazyradio PA and the nrf-research-firmware by Bastille Networks
Internet Security [2, 3].

The following output of the developed proof-of-concept software tool
illustrates a successful attack:

[*] Configure nRF24 radio
[*] Actively searching for address 07:C2:9E:20:7F
[*] Ping success on channel 8
[*] Ping success on channel 8
[*] Press <CTRL+C> to start keystroke injection

This demonstrated keystroke injection attack also worked in 2016 against
the wireless presenter Logitech R400, which is described in the SySS
security advisory SYSS-2016-074 [4].
