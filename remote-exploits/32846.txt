~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Inateck WP1001 is a wireless presenter using 2.4 GHz radio
communication.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"* 2.4GHz Wireless Connection allows you to move around while
   giving presentations
 * Fingertip Controls make it easy for you to adjust the volume, change
   slides and more
 * Red Laser Pointer words up to 65 feet(20m) away
 * LCD Screen with timer vibration and low-battery indicator
 * Includes Carrying Case to help protect your device on the go
"

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless
presenter Inateck WP1001 is prone to keystroke injection attacks.

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the wireless presenter Inateck WP1001 is
vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data
packets of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless
presenter to the receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used
protocol. By knowing the used data protocol, it is possible to inject
packets in the data communication that are actually interpreted as
keystrokes by the receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of
an Inateck WP1001 wireless presenter. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
the wireless presenter Inateck WP1001 using the open-source software
tool Universal Radio Hacker [2] in combination with the software-defined
radio HackRF One [3].
