Vulnerability Description:

==============================

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in
Visualware MyConnection Server 11.0 through 11.0b build 5382. The web
endpoint at "https://example.com/myspeed/sf" provides an unauthenticated
user the ability to upload an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location via a
specially crafted POST request. This application is written in Java and is
thus cross-platform. The Windows installation executes the web server as
SYSTEM which means that exploitation provides Administrator privileges on
the target system.
