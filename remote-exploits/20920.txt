title: HP System Management Homepage JustGetSNMPQueue Command Injection
author: metasploit
cves: CVE-2013-3576

This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability found in HP System Management Homepage. By supplying a specially crafted HTTP request, it is possible to control the 'tempfilename' variable in function JustGetSNMPQueue (found in ginkgosnmp.inc), which will be used in a exec() function. This results in arbitrary code execution under the context of SYSTEM. Please note: In order for the exploit to work, the victim must enable the 'tftp' command, which is the case by default for systems such as Windows XP, 2003, etc.
