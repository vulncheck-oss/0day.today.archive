VLC media player is prone to a heap-based memory-corruption vulnerability.
 
Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.
 
An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to open a malicious media file containing malicious subtitles with the vulnerable application.
 
The following proof-of-concept commands are available:
 
1. echo -ne '<foo\0crashme' | dd conv=notrunc bs=1 seek=877862 \ of=refined-australia-blu720p-sample.mkv
 
2. vlc --sub-language English refined-australia-blu720p-sample.mkv
