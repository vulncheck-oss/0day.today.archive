title: MySQL 5.0.x IF Query Handling Remote Denial Of Service Vulnerability
author: Neil Kettle
cves: CVE-2007-2583

MySQL is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle certain specially crafted queries.
 
An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the application, denying access to legitimate users.
 
NOTE: An attacker must be able to execute arbitrary SELECT statements against the database to exploit this issue. This may be through legitimate means or by exploiting other latent SQL-injection vulnerabilities.
 
Versions prior to MySQL 5.0.40 are vulnerable. 
 
SELECT id from example WHERE id IN(1, (SELECT IF(1=0,1,2/0)));
