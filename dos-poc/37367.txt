Telegram Android v8.4.4 - Denial of Service (PoC)


Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Telegram is a freeware, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging (IM)
service. The service also provides end-to-end encrypted video calling,
VoIP, file sharing and several other features. It was launched for iOS on
14 August 2013 and Android in October 2013. The servers of Telegram are
distributed worldwide to decrease frequent data load with five data centers
in different regions, while the operational center is based in Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates. Various client apps are available for desktop and
mobile platforms including official apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS
and Linux (although registration requires an iOS or Android device and a
working phone number). There are also two official Telegram web twin apps –
WebK and WebZ – and numerous unofficial clients that make use of Telegram's
protocol. All of Telegram's official components are open source, with the
exception of the server which is closed-sourced and proprietary.

Telegram provides end-to-end encrypted voice and video calls and optional
end-to-end encrypted "secret" chats. Cloud chats and groups are encrypted
between the app and the server, so that ISPs and other third-parties on the
network can't access data, but the Telegram server can. Users can send text
and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share an unlimited
number of images, documents (2 GB per file), user locations, animated
stickers, contacts, and audio files. In January 2021, Telegram surpassed
500 million monthly active users. It was the most downloaded app worldwide
in January 2021 with 1 billion downloads globally as of late August 2021.
