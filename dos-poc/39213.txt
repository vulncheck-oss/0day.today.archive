#1. Description

#His technique works fine against Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2
and 3 (English).
#For this exploit I have tried several strategies to increase reliability
and performance:
#Jump to a static 'call esp'
#Backwards jump to code a known distance from the stack pointer.
#The server did not properly handle request with large amounts of data via
FTP command RNFR.
#The following request sends a large amount of data to the FTP server to
process across command RNFR, the server will crash as soon as it is
received and processed, causing denial of service conditions.
#Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to crash
the affected server, denying service to legitimate users.
