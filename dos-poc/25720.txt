author: Nils Sommer
cves: CVE-2015-6174

Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=534
 
The attached PoC triggers a null pointer condition on Windows 7 32-bit, which can potentially be exploited on versions of Windows that allow mapping the null page (e.g. Windows 7 32-bit).
---
 
Note that multiple PoC executions and simulated system activity (such as opening Explorer) may be required to trigger this issue.
