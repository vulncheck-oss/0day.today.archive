=====================================
Office 2 iPhone XLS Denial of Service
=====================================


I wrote a fuzzer "dumb fuzzer" and used a sample from http://www.inj3ct0r.com/sploits/12662.xls  
which I randomly found on the internet. 
I mutated the data and tested roughly 1000 cases on several Document Reader Applications for iPhone.
