==============================================================================================
Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird/Seamonkey CVE-2010-0167 Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities
==============================================================================================

 
Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey are prone to multiple remote memory-corruption vulnerabilities.
 
Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.
 
NOTE: These issues were previously covered in BID 38918 (Mozilla Firefox Thunderbird and Seamonkey MFSA 2010-09 through -15 Multiple Vulnerabilities) but have been assigned their own record to better document them.
