title: Adobe Flash - Sprite Creation Use-After-Free
author: Google Security Research
cves: CVE-2016-1000

Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=718
 
There is a use-after-free in Sprite Creation. If a Sprite is created, and then the handler for the frameConstructed event triggers a remove object action, the Sprite is then used after it has been freed.
 
A sample swf is attached.
