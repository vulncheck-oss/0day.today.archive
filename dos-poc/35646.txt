Vulnerability Details:

Mail delivery / parsing crashed when the 10 000th MIME part was
message/rfc822 (or if parent was multipart/digest). This happened
due to earlier MIME parsing changes for CVE-2020-12100.

Risk:

Malicious sender can crash dovecot repeatedly by sending / uploading
message with more than 10 000 MIME parts.

Workaround:

These are usually dropped by MTA, where the mitigation can also be applied.

Solution:

Operators should update to 2.3.13 or later version.
