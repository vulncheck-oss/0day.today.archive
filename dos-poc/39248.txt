# Exploit Title: LightFTP 1.1 - Denial of Service (DoS)
# Discovery by: Fernando Mengali
# Discovery Date: 15 january 2024
# Vendor Homepage:  N/A
# Notification vendor: No reported
# Tested Version: LightFTP 1.1
# Tested on: Window XP Professional - Service Pack 2 and 3 - English
# Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service (DoS)

#1. Description

#His technique works fine against Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and 3 (English).
#For this exploit I have tried several strategies to increase reliability and performance:
#Jump to a static 'call esp'
#Backwards jump to code a known distance from the stack pointer.
#The server does not correctly handle the amount of data or bytes of the USERNAME entered by the user.
#When authenticating to the FTP server with a long USERNAME or a USERNAME with a large number of characters for the FTP server to process, the server will crash as soon as it is received and processed, causing denial of service conditions.
#Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to crash the affected server, denying service to legitimate users.

#2. Proof of Concept - PoC
