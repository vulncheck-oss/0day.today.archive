I. BACKGROUND

EQS Integrity Line is a proprietary whistleblowing software which enables
employees to report misconduct such as corruption, abuses of power and
discrimination internally before complaints become public and, in serious
cases, result in financial losses as well as reputational damage.

II. DESCRIPTION

Multiple Vulnerabilities exist in EQS Integrity Line software.

The present advisory highlights two distinct vulnerabilities, namely (A)
XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007] and (B) Use of GET Request
Method With Sensitive Query Strings [CWE-598].

III. ANALYSIS

A) XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007]

EQS Integrity Line through 2022-07-01 allows a stored XSS via a crafted
whistleblower entry.

In order to exploit this vulnerability no account is required on the
whistleblowing software.

The vulnerability resides in the whistleblowing questionnaire
implementation that enables anonymous, non authenticated, users to inject
malicious XSS vectors due to missing or improper input sanitization.
Also content security policies (CSP) that could prevent or limit the attack
are absent.

The vulnerability is present on the whistleblowing form, and can be
triggered using the following example input:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

<img src= onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
 
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

Due to the vulnerability, an attacker posing as a whistleblower could
upload an XSS vector in the submission form loading malicious code to be
reflected and executed in the context of the browser session of the
Recipient of the submission, that is typically an Anticorruption Officer
or an Internal Auditor.

Being able to execute code in the context of the target, and due to the
absence of additional mitigations (e.g. the HttpOnly flag for cookies)
the attacker could possibly obtain a copy of the target session cookie
useful to impersonate and operate in place of the target user and
execute automated operations on behalf of the target user by accessing
all the reports present on the system or possibly impact the integrity
of the system by deleting reports or interfering with ongoing
communications with a real whistleblower.

In short: a standard XSS attack scenario.

The test for the presence of this vulnerability has been performed on the
first input only, to not risk to cause any damage to the application.
It is advised to execute a proper complete audit of the application with
respect to this kind of vulnerability.

The vulnerability was first identified performing an independent security
audit to evaluate and ensure the security of the EU Sanctions Whistleblower
Tool of the European Commission enabling whistleblowers to report possible
violation of EU sanctions hosted at:

https://eusanctions.integrityline.com/
   
B) Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings [CWE-598]

EQS Integrity Line through 2022-07-01 leaves sensitive traces in the browser
history of whistleblowers using the application and possibly in the logs
of other network appliances involved in the communication.

When a whistleblower makes a submission, the system assigns a unique
identifier to the submission and enables to choose a pin that is intended
to be used by users in combination with the unique identifier to access
the system in order to communicate with the recipients of their own report.

The implementation of the session makes use of GET variables that include
the unique identifier in the navigated URL to access the report.
Such an implementation is prone to sensible information leakage making it
possible for an auditor accessing the browser history of the
whistleblower's device to clearly identify the evidence of a performed
submission.

It is advised to perform full review of the application to get sure that
the application reduces the sensible traces left in the browser history of
the user.

IV. WORKAROUND

The vendor has fixed the XSS and implemented a CSP in date 2022-07-01

V. CVE INFORMATION

XSS Vulnerability (stored) [CVE-2022-34007]
