ETAP Safety Manager 1.0.0.32 Remote Unauthenticated Reflected XSS


Vendor: ETAP Lighting International NV
Product web page: https://www.etaplighting.com
Affected version: 1.0.0.32

Summary: The ETAP Safety Manager (ESM) is a central managing and control
system that helps you to monitor, adjust and maintain your emergency lighting
system. Therefore each luminaire connected to your ESM network is given a
unique code. The ESM can easily identify the luminaires individually and
automatically report whether all luminaires work properly. You can either
choose between a wired or wireless network, or a combination of both. With
ESM you will not only manage your self contained or your centrally supplied
‘ETAP Battery System’ (EBS) emergency luminaires’, but also DALI emergency
units and K9 LED modules, which you can build into your luminaires. Since
your ESM system is connected to the Internet, you will always have access
to it through the World Wide Web. ESMweb™ is an ‘embedded web server’
application for monitoring an emergency lighting system, which runs in the
‘ESM web controller’. The ESMweb™ application can be accessed from any PC
in the corporate network or connected to the Internet - by a standard web
browser.

Desc: Input passed to the GET parameter 'action' is not properly sanitised
before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary
HTML/JS code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Tested on: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
