1. Vulnerability Description

 

The OpenAsset Digital Asset Management web application allowed for spoofing of IP addresses by using X-Forwarded-For header. By default, the web application would allow all traffic in for 127.0.0.1, in order to prevent users from accidentally blocking themselves.

 

2. PoC

 

Ensure a web application endpoint has been blocked for a specific IP address or alternatively, use a * to block all IP address. Confirm the block is in place by attempting to make a request to the endpoint. Next, add the following to the request header:

 

X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1

 

The request will not be blocked, allowing access to potentially dangerous endpoints or sensitive data.

 

3. Solution

 

The vendor provides an updated version (11.4.10) which should be installed immediately. If using the cloud version, the vendor has already updated it.
