## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload, https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload

## Description:
The class parameter btn-btn-danger-js-labelFile is vulnerable to File Upload and RCE attacks, it is not sanitized correctly.
The attacker can upload a virus directly on the server by using this web vulnerability, and then he can execute it, this can be 
the end of this server depending on the scenario! In this case, I just renamed the directory images =)
