title: WordPress GD bbPress Attachments 2.1 Cross Site Scripting / Local File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
author: Tom Adams
cves: 

Details
================
Software: GD bbPress Attachments
Version: 2.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/gd-bbpress-attachments/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-gd-bbpress-attachments-allows-an-attacker-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in GD bbPress Attachments allows an attacker to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin outputs the value of $_GET[‘tab’] without escaping (see forms/panels.php lines 3 and 39). An attacker could easily construct an URL which performs virtually any action an admin is able to perform, including creating/deleting users/posts, injecting malicious HTML into user-facing pages, or editing PHP files (if that feature hasn’t been disabled).

Proof of concept
================
Visit the following URL in a browser with no reflected XSS protection (i.e. Firefox or older versions of IE):
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=forum&page=gdbbpress_attachments&tab=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Description
================
Local File Include vulnerability in GD bbPress Attachments allows attackers to include arbitrary PHP files

Vulnerability
================
An attacker who is an admin can easily include any .php file on the server.
An attacker who can get an admin to follow a link they control will also be able to include that PHP file. It is easy to make these links very convincing.
They could exploit this to attempt to exhaust the server’s resources by including the file that includes the arbitrary file in an infinite loop.
If they’re additionally able to upload arbitrary PHP files (via an admin account or some other vulnerability) they’ll be able to run arbitrary code on the server.
 

Proof of concept
================
Visit this URL to cause an infinite loop:
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=forum&page=gdbbpress_attachments&tab=../panels

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.3 or later
