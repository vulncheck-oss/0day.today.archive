Online Diagnostic Lab Management System 1.0 is vulnerable to stored cross-site-scripting.
Stored cross-site scripting (persistent XSS) arises when an application receives its data from
an untrusted source and includes that data within its responses in an unsafe way.

#Steps to Reproduce

1. Login to the admin account with username 'admin' and password 'admin123'

2. Navigate to the 'User List' option 

3. Create new user by adding following payload in
   First Name and Last Name fields.
   <image src/onerror=prompt(document.cookie)>

4. XSS payload will be triggered in the page http://localhost/odlms/admin/?page=user/list
