An authenticated user in Kaseya for viewing some remote computers can view every remote computer on the server. This is done via changing the URL to point to the remote computer that the person wants to view. As stated above, this issue should be present in all calls to the remote computer, but due to scope, we could not test every vector.

Steps to reproduce

-   Change the agentGuid in the URL
