Introduction:
=============
Using Complete Gallery Manager will make it fun and fast to manage and create galleries for your website. 
The plugin enables a wealth of functionality, but just because you can take advantage of its many features, 
doesn’t mean you necessarily should. For each feature you implement you should consider the benefit for 
your users. Don’t make the interface more complex than necessary. Less is more!

We have made it very easy for you to customize basically anything you can imagine. The Isotype Gallery has 
188 different settings you can tweak and the Touch Slider has 146 different settings.

Details:
========
A arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is detected in the CodeCanyon Wordpress Plugin Complete Gallery Manager v3.3.3 Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to upload files via POST method with multiple extensions to unauthorized access them on 
application-side of the service.

The vulnerability is located in the /plugins/complete-gallery-manager/frames/ path when processing to upload via the  upload-images.php
