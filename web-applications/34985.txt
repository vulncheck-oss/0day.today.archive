~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

DOMOS is a hardened operating system of Secudos GmbH. This operating
system is
used for different applications of the said company. It offers a web
interface to
easily perform administrative tasks within the operating system.

Due to insufficient input validation of user-provided data, it is
vulnerable to
OS command injection.

The default configuration after deploying the appliance does not grant
remote
access to the web interface. Instead, this interface is bound to a local
IP address.

As due to the requirements of valid admin credentials and network access to
the appliance, the vulnerability is rated as a low security risk.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The tasks which are initiated from within the web application use Python
scripts on the back-end server to change server settings. Within these
scripts
user input is concatenated within the function os.system() of Python which
itself will initiate the operating system command.

For example, the script 'conf_datetime', which is located at
/opt/secudos/DomosConf/scripts, uses os.system() in an insecure manner,
as can be
seen here:

# /etc/sysconfig/clock
    fn = '/etc/sysconfig/clock'
    zone = db.get('datetime.clock.timezone', 'Europe/Berlin')
    try:
        fout = open(fn,'w')
        fout.write('ZONE="'+zone+'"\n')
        fout.write('UTC=true\n')
        fout.write('ARC=false\n')
        fout.close()
    except:
        print "Can't create",fn

    # /etc/localtime
    fn = '/etc/localtime'
    fln = '/usr/share/zoneinfo/' + zone
    try:
        cmd = '/bin/ln -sf ' + fln + ' ' + fn
        os.system(cmd)

The parameter 'zone' is defined as a field within the web interface.
By using an intercepting proxy and changing the value from 'Europe/Berlin'
to 'Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime; touch /tmp/hacked; cat', for example, the
file 'hacked' is created at '/tmp/' when applying the settings.

Furthermore, the script is run as root which is also a local privilege
escalation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

By using the above technique, it was possible to echo the output of the
command
'id' into a file, thus proving that the script be run as root:

[admin@localhost ~]$ cat /tmp/hacked
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Also refer to [1] for a weaponized exploit.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The issue was fixed in version DOMOS 5.8.1. Upgrade to this version.
