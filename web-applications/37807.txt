Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2022-29034)
The application contains a reflected cross-site-scripting vulnerability that
can be used to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2022-29034)
The error occurs when setting the syslog server to an illegal IP address. An
error message will pop up and will reflect the supplied IP address. However,
the popup message does not use the proper JQuery method, and thus allows to
inject JavaScript code. Note that dots can not be used in the JavaScript
payload, as they will get filtered by the IP parser that runs beforehand.
This was circumvented by supplying the JavaScript code in base64.

Following request can be used to trigger the XSS:

POST /services/syslog_client_settings HTTP/1.1
Host: $host
Cookie: sessionid=708xmctjzk39og596jp4q4r1udfom4l5;
