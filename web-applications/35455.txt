Advanced Component System (ACS) 1.0 Path Traversal Vulnerability

*Description:* Affected Component:
http://localhost/advanced_component_system/index.php?ACS_path=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd%00

*Vulnerability Type:* Path Traversal
https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal*Vendor of Product:
*Advanced Comment System - ACS

*Version:* v1.0

*Attack Type:* Remote

*Impact:* A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims
to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root
folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash
(../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may
be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system
including application source code or configuration and critical system
files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system
operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files
on the Microsoft Windows operating system). This attack is also known as
“dot-dot-slash”, “directory traversal”, “directory climbing” and
“backtracking”.
