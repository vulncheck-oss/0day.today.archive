title: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller 1.7.1.0 Undocumented Account Vulnerability
author: Jim Becher
cves: CVE-2021-33216

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: CommScope
     Affected Product: Ruckus IoT Controller
     Affected Version: 1.7.1.0 and earlier
     Platform: Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
     CVE ID: CVE-2021-33216


2. Vulnerability Description

     An upgrade account is included in the IoT Controller OVA that
     provides the vendor undocumented access via Secure Copy (SCP).


3. Technical Description

     Once the OVA is imported into VirtualBox, a VMDK file is
     created. The VMDK file can be mounted and the directory
     structure and its contents can be perused.

     An authorized_keys file exists that allows an
     individual/organization possessing the SSH private key to
     access the virtual appliance using the 'vriotiotupgrade'
     account. The 'vriotiotupgrade' account is restricted to scp,
     per the rssh configuration.

     Additionally, it appears that the IoT Controller has rssh version 2.3.4
     installed and in use. At the time of this advisory, there are at least
     three remote command injection vulnerabilities in this particular version
     of rssh: CVE-2019-3463, CVE-2019-3464 and CVE-2019-1000018.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (1.8.0.0) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:
