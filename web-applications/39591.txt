fromdate=<script>alert(1)</script>&todate=2024-04-18&submit=

```

- In this POST request, an attacker has included a script tag in the "fromdate" and "todate" field:

`<script>alert(1)</script>`

- Upon successful exploitation, an alert box containing the text "1" will be displayed on the victim's browser, indicating that the XSS vulnerability has been successfully exploited.


### Impact:

- The impact of this vulnerability is significant. Attackers can exploit it to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web page. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing attacks, or defacement of the website.
