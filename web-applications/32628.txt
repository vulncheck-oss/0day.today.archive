CVE-2019-0213: Apache Archiva Stored XSS

Severity: Low

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
    Apache Archiva 2.0.0 - 2.2.3
    The unsupported versions 1.x are also affected.  

It may be possible to store malicious XSS code into central configuration entries, i.e. the logo URL. 
The vulnerability is considered as minor risk, as only users with admin role can change the configuration, or the communication 
between the browser and the Archiva server must be compromised. 

Mitigation:
  All users are recommended to upgrade to Archiva 2.2.4 or higher,

CVE-2019-0214: Apache Archiva arbitrary file write and delete on the server

Severity: Medium

It is possible to write files to the archiva server at arbitrary locations by using the artifact upload mechanism. 
Existing files can be overwritten, if the archiva run user has appropriate permission on the filesystem for the target file.

Mitigation:
  It is highly recommended to upgrade to Archiva 2.2.4 or higher, where additional validations are implemented to prevent such malicious parameter values.
  As intermediate action you may reduce the number of users that are allowed to upload to archiva and make sure, that the archiva run user may have only 
  write permission to the directories needed.
