author: neutr0n
cves: 

The Full Path Disclosure is vBulletin 4.2.0, in forumrunner. With Full Path Disclosure you can get the path to the forum you're in and also (most of the times is the same) cpanel's username. 

To see it go to:

http://[path]/forumrunner/include/album.php

It works in 90% of the forums.
