Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor did not respond to our communication attempts, hence no patch is
available.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly
advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Stored Cross Site Scripting via Filename (Authenticated user)
This vulnerability allows an authenticated user (admin) to upload files
with a malicious client side script as filename. It will be executed in
the browser of a user if he visits the manipulated URL.

2. Directory Traversal (Authenticated user)
This vulnerability allows an authenticated user (admin) to delete arbitrary
files via directory traversal on the operating system with the access rights
of the web server.

3. Upload of arbitrary files (Authenticated user)
It was identified that an authenticated user (admin) can bypass file type
checks and upload malicious files. In this specific case, arbitrary server
side PHP code such as web shells can be uploaded. As a result the attacker
can run arbitrary code on the server side with the privileges of the web
server. This could lead to a full system compromise.
