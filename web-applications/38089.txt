title: Evernote Web Clipper Same-Origin Policy Bypass Vulnerability

Evernote: extension allows cross-origin iframe communication

I happened to notice that the Evernote Web Clipper (3,000,000+ users) allows any website to bypass the same origin policy.

If you send a message like window.postMessage({type: \"EN_request\", name: \"EN_SerializeTo\", data: { frameName: id }), the frame DOM is collected and then posted back to the top window.

I made a quick demo exploit: https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/oov6Wahv.html

I notice the evernote website requests that all vulnerabilities are submitted via HackerOne, but I'm unwilling to do that.

I'll send a report to the Chrome Webstore policy team instead, who can handle contacting the registered developer.
