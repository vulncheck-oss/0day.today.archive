Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these products
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all security
issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Multiple Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2021-31537)
The login website returns unfiltered or unescaped user input. This leads to a
reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the victim's
web browser. Once the victim clicks on a malicious link, the attacker's code
is executed in the context of the victim's web browser.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Multiple Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2021-31537)
When opening the following URL the supplied JavaScript code will be executed.
/rewe/prod/web/index.php?config=rewe2%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22document.domain%22)%3C/script%3E&version=7.5.0&win=2707&user=test&pwd=test&db=test&continue=false
The affected parameters are: "config", "version", "win","db", "pwd", and
"user".

No valid parameters need to be supplied to trigger the XSS vulnerability as
seen in following URL:
/rewe/prod/web/index.php?abc'-alert(%22document.domain%22)-'abc=1

The following URL is affected as well:
/rewe/prod/web/rewe_go_check.php?config=rewe&version=7.5.0%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3e&win=2707
All parameters are affected.
