VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION:
==========================
Alt-N MDaemon is prone to an HTML/Javascript injection vulnerability
because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input.
 
Attacker-supplied HTML and/or JavaScript code could run in the context
of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal
cookie-based authentication credentials and control how the site is
rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
 
Alt-N MDaemon v13.0.3 & v12.5.6 were tested and found vulnerable;
other versions may also be affected.
