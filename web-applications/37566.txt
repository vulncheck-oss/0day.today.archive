[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]
RefTree is a web application made for managing complex real estate situations.
Among other features, it offers the possibility for authenticated users
to upload and download DWG (CAD drawings) files for buildings.

During a penetration test activity, a "Directory Traversal" vulnerability
was found on the download feature which allows to download arbitrary files
with the "dwg" extension. The application actually checks that the filename
ends with "dwg", so it's not possible to download files with other extensions.

This vulnerability may also allow to steal NTLM hashes of the host system
by supplying, as the download path, a UNC path pointing to an 
attacker controlled machine running a tool like Responder.

[VULNERABLE VERSIONS]

1. Log into the application to get a valid session cookie
2. Use the API endpoint '/CaddemServiceJS/CaddemService.svc/rest/DownloadDwg'
