# 1. Introduction

eGain Chat is a real time chat assistance solution by eGain Corporation for website visitors to communicate with chat agents.

# 2. Vulnerability Details

eGain Chat version 15.5.5 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS).

The “Name” input field (full_name) does not fully sanitise user input for special characters such as “<” or “>” and HTML attributes such as “<a href>”. It is possible for an attacker to bypass filtering and create malicious scripts. Once the response has been rendered, the malicious JavaScript code would be executed.

# 3. Proof of Concept

The “Name” input field (full_name) of the chat window can be injected with the following XSS payload as a Proof of Concept to execute a javascript alert popup.

Payload - <a href="javascript&#58alert(document.domain)">click</a>
