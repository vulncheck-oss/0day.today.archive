----Local File Inclusion----------------------------

There is a file inclusion vulnerability in the mla-file-downloader.php file. Example:

http://server/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/media-library-assistant/includes/mla-file-downloader.php?mla_download_type=text/html&mla_download_file=C:\Bitnami\wordpress-5.3.2-2\apps\wordpress\htdocs\wp-content\plugins\updraftplus\options.php

Visiting the above URL would lead to disclosure of the contents of options.php. Note that this vulnerability does not require authentication.


----Multiple Cross-Site-Scripting-------------------

There are both reflected and stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in almost all Settings/Media Library Assistant tabs, which allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript. 

Note that this vulnerability requires authentication.



Tested on Windows 7 Pro SP1 32-bit and Wordpress 5.3.2
