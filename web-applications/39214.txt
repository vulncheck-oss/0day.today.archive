title: Apache 2.4.55 mod_proxy HTTP Request Smuggling Exploit
author: Amirhossein Bahramizadeh
cves: CVE-2023-25690

# Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through
# 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected
# when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or
# ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the
# user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the
# proxied request-target using variable substitution. For example, something
# like: RewriteEngine on RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "
# http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P] ProxyPassReverse /here/
# http://example.com:8080/ Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass
# of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to
# existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to
# update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.
