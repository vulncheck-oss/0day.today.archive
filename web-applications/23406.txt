Oracle NoSQL is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.
 
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain arbitrary local files in the context of the webserver process.
 
NoSQL 11g 1.1.100 R2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
