Technical Details
--------------------

Zen Cart 1.5.7 was improperly sanitizing user input in HTTP GET parameter
names, which led to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin
area. The impact of this vulnerability is lessened due to the fact that the
name of the admin panel must be set to a random or user-supplied name.

Resolution: The vulnerability is fixed in Zen Cart v1.5.7c.
Scope: It affected only users of Zen Cart v1.5.7, v1.5.7a, and v1.5.7b.
Fix: Users can consult the release announcement for guidance on applying
the patched files related to upgrading to v1.5.7c
