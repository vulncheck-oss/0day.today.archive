CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller 1.7.1.0 Unauthenticated API Endpoints


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: CommScope
     Affected Product: Ruckus IoT Controller
     Affected Version: 1.7.1.0 and earlier
     Platform: Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
     CVE ID: CVE-2021-33221


2. Vulnerability Description

     Three API endpoints for the IoT Controller are accessible
     without authentication. Two of the endpoints result in
     information leakage and consumption of computing/storage
     resources. The third API endpoint that does not require
     authentication allows for a factory reset of the IoT Controller.


3. Technical Description

     A "service details" API endpoint discloses system and
     configuration information to an attacker without requiring
     authentication. This information includes DNS and NTP servers
     that the devices uses for time and host resolution. It also
     includes the internal hostname and IoT Controller version. A
     fully configured device in production may leak other, more
     sensitive information (API keys and tokens).

     Another API endpoint that can be accessed without authentication
     can be used to generate diagnostic/support files. The process
     of generating these diagnostic files consumes CPU and disk
     utilization. The files can be retrieved, but are encrypted.

     The third API endpoint that can be accessed without
     authentication will reset the virtual appliance back in to a
     factory reset condition - removing the current configuration
     of the device.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (1.8.0.0) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:
