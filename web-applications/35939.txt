QCubed SQL Injection
==================

| Target: | QCubed Framework |
| Vendor: | QCubed |
| Version: | all versions including 3.1.1 |
| CVE: | CVE-2020-24913 |
| Accessibility: | Remote |
| Severity: | Critical |
| Author: | Wolfgang Hotwagner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology) |

SUMMARY
=======
QCubed is a PHP Model-View-Controller Rappid Application Development framework. (https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed)

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
=========================
A SQL injection vulnerability in qcubed (all versions including 3.1.1)  in profile.php via the strQuery parameter allows an unauthenticated  attacker to access the database by injecting SQL code via a crafted POST  request.  The strQuery parameter of the serialized array in profile.php  could lead to a sql-injection. This parameter is used by the  PrintExplainStatement which simply concats "EXPLAIN ." with this  parameter:

public function ExplainStatement($sql) {
     return $this->Query("EXPLAIN " . $sql);
}


This query will be executed unfiltered.

We were able to write proof-of concept exploit for mysql and postgres.  Unfortunately with mysql we were not able to use a  stacked-queries-payload and we had to exploit this vulnerability with a  timebased approach.


VULNERABLE VERSIONS
===================
All versions including 3.1.1 are affected.


TESTED VERSIONS
===============
QCubed 3.1.1

IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated attacker could  access the database remotely. In  worst case scenarios an attacker might be able to execute code on the  remote machine

MITIGATION
==========

A patch was delivered by QCubed that allows to disable the profile-functionality( https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed/pull/1320/files ).
