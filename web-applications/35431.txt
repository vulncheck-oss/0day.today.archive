Technical Details & Description:
================================
An insufficient session validation vulnerability has been discovered in
the official VestaCP (Control Panel) v0.9.8-26 hosting web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain sensitive
web-application data or information without permission, authentication
or authorization.

The backup url includes a token parameter for the download request on
backups. The mechanism is to secure that other users can only download the
backup with the token to confirm the permission. The token is not
required for the download and can be deattached in the client-side
session request.
The session validation of the backup download request is insufficient
validating the request without token parameter approval. Next to that
the backup
uses the name of the privileges in combination with the date in a tar
compressed folder. Thus allows a remote attacker with low user
privileges to
download the backup data without permission.

Successful exploitation of the session web vulnerability results in
information disclosure of the local application and dbms backup files.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /download/backup/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] token

Affected Parameter(s):
[+] backup


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The insufficient session validation vulnerability can be exploited by
remote attackers with simple user privileges without user interaction.
