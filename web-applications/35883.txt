"genugate Firewall: Well Protected Against Attacks

Your level of IT security is determined largely at the interface between the
Internet and the local network. The attacks from the outside and the data
sent from the inside pass through this point.

The High Resistance Firewall genugate satisfies the highest requirements:
two different firewall systems – an application level gateway and
a packet filter, each on separate hardware – are combined to form a compact
solution. genugate is approved for classification levels German and NATO
RESTRICTED and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED. genugate is certified according
to CC EAL 4+"

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version for the affected products which should
be installed immediately.

Customers should also adhere to security best practices such as network
segmentation and limiting access to the admin panel. This is also a requirement
for certified and approved environments.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-27215)
The Admin Web interface, the Sidechannel Web and Userweb interface can use different
methods to perform the authentication of a user. A specific authentication method during
login does not check the provided data and returns OK for any authentication request. This
allows an attacker to login to the admin panel with a user of his choice, e.g the root
user with highest privileges or even a non-existing user.

An attacker needs to have network access to the admin interface. Certified and approved
environments mandate that the admin interface is only reachable through a strictly
separated network. Nevertheless, it is a highly critical security vulnerability and
must be patched immediately.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-27215)
During the authentication requests at the login page of the admin web interface, the
Sidechannel Web and Userweb interface, certain HTTP POST parameters are passed to the
server. By manipulating a specific parameter method, an attacker is able to bypass
the authentication easily and login as arbitrary user.
