Product: VTiger v7.0 - CRM (Web-Application)



Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in
the official VTiger v7.0 CRM open-source web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the
`searchValue` Parameter of the `Emails Compose` module.
Attackers are able to inject own mlicious script code in the `To` sender
input field of the email compose module to attack other
user accounts. The email can be delivered with multiple receipients
which allows an attacker to insert the target email and a
malicious payload. The request method to inject is GET via searchValue
and POST on compose with persistent attack vector.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected
application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Email Compose (index.php?module=Emails)

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] To (Sender - Email)
