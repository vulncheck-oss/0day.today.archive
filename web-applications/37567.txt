[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]
RefTree is a web application made for managing complex real estate situations.
Among other features, it offers the possibility for authenticated users
to upload and download DWG (CAD drawings) files for buildings.

During a penetration test activity, an "Unrestricted File Upload" vulnerability
was found which leverages the upload feature to upload a file anywhere on the 
target system.

By uploading a malicious web page, like an aspx web shell, to the server's
web root it is possible to achive code execution by just navigating to the
malicious page with a web browser.

[VULNERABLE VERSIONS]
IdeaRE RefTree < 2021.09.17

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]
It is possible to reproduce the issue following these steps:
1. Log into the application to get a valid session cookie
2. Get a valid "ObjId" from the application (the ID of a building to associate
   the file to)
3. Use the API endpoint '/CaddemServiceJS/CaddemService.svc/rest/UploadDwg'
   to upload a file on the target system, for example a web shell in the
   server's web root
4. Navigate to the new page with a web browser to trigger code execution
