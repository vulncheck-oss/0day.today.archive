# Version: Zeus Cart 4.0 CSRF

1. Vulnerability Description

Due to the form not being validated, ZeusCart4.0 suffers from a Cross
Site Request Forgery vulnerability, which means an attacker can
perform actions on behalf of a victim, by having the victim visit an
attacker controlled site.

In this case, the attacker is able to "deactivate" any customer
accounts, which means that the account is banned and cannot login.
