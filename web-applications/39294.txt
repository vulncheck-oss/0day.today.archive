# Exploit Title: CVE-2024-21733 Apache Tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
# Date: 1/31/2024
# Exploit Author: xer0dayz
# Vendor Homepage: https://tomcat.apache.org/
# Software Link: https://tomcat.apache.org/
# Version: 8.5.7 to 8.5.63 or 9.0.44 or later
# CVE : CVE-2024-21733

## Description:
Apache Tomcat from 8.5.7 through 8.5.63, from 9.0.0-M11 through 9.0.43 are vulnerable to client-side de-sync attacks.

Client-side de-sync (CSD) vulnerabilities occur when a web server fails to correctly process the Content-Length of POST requests. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can force a victim's browser to de-synchronize its connection with the website, causing sensitive data to be smuggled from the server and/or client connections.

## Remediation:
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.5.64 onwards or 9.0.44 onwards, which contain a fix for the issue.
