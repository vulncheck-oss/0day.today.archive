Vendor description:
- -------------------
"Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX) is Oracle's primary tool for
developing Web applications with SQL and PL/SQL. Using only a web browser, you
can develop and deploy professional Web-based applications for desktops and
mobile devices. It is a fully supported, no cost option of the Oracle
Database, and is installed by default in all editions of the Oracle Database.
Even those without SQL and PL/SQL knowledge, can still easily install the many
built-in packaged applications, such as Survey Builder, Customer Tracker, and
P-Track (for tracking projects)."

Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
The gReport Controls Sort Widget is prone to permanent Cross-Site Scripting.
The setting "display as" of the column attributes is ignored for the filter
list.


Proof of concept:
- -----------------
Adding the following field to a table will cause an alertbox to display the
currently set cookies as soon as the sort options are selected for the column:

xss-entry<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>


Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
All versions prior to 4.2.3.00.08
