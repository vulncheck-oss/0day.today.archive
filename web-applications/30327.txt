# Version: 1.1
# Tested on: Ubuntu 17.10
# CVE: CVE-2018-10580
 
 
1. Description:
Adds a new section to user profiles that will display their last posts.
  
 
2. Proof of Concept:
 
Persistent XSS
- Create a thread with the following subject <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Now visit your profile to see the alert.
 
 
3. Solution:
I reported the plugin twice over the past 3 weeks and recieved no response.
 
 
The following should be added in line 236 to properly sanitize thread subjects.
 
$d['tsubject'] = htmlspecialchars_uni($d['tsubject']);
