Bounty Award: $2,751.00

The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via the /includes/backup-heart.php file. This is due to an attacker being able to control the values passed to an include, and subsequently leverage that to achieve remote code execution. This makes it possible for unauthenticated threat actors to easily execute code on the server.

Technical Analysis

Line 118 within the /includes/backup-heart.php file used by the Backup Migration plugin attempts to include bypasser.php from the BMI_INCLUDES directory. The BMI_INCLUDES directory is defined by concatenating BMI_ROOT_DIR with the includes string on line 64. However, note that BMI_ROOT_DIR is defined via the content-dir HTTP header on line 62.

This means that the BMI_ROOT_DIR is user-controllable. By submitting a specially-crafted request, threat-actors can leverage this issue to include arbitrary, malicious PHP code and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server in the security context of the WordPress instance.
