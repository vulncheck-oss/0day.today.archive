2014.08.01 - announced at my site about previous vulnerabilities in DCS-2103.
2014.11.14-2014.12.13 - conversation with D-Link about vulnerabilities in DCS-2103.
2014.11.27 - announced at my site about new vulnerabilities in DCS-2103.

I found this and other web cameras during summer 2014 to watch terrorists
activities in Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine and also in Russia
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2015-July/009110.html).
