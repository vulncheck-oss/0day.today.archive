Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple reflected cross site scripting web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the Affiliate Pro - Affiliate Management System v1.7.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise client-site
browser to web-application requests.

The non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in the `email`,`username` and `fullname` parameters of the `index` module.
Attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the `Fullname`,`Username` or `Email` input fields to manipulate client-side requests.
The request method to inject is post and the attack vector is non-persistent (reflected) on client-side. The injection- and execution points are
located in the index formular for affiliates to enter.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects to
malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] index

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Email
[+] Username
[+] Fullname

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] email
[+] username
[+] fullname


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low or medium user interaction.
