Description:
An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the btn_login_b_Click
function of the affected web application. The vulnerability exists due to
the improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login form.
Specifically, the txt_login_username.Text and txt_login_pass.Text fields
are concatenated directly into an SQL query string without proper
parameterization or escaping.

Endpoint: https://localhost:44306/Users/Loginpage.aspx

Username: kihsan'--
