Indicators of Compromise

Based on our analysis of the attack data, a majority of attackers are attempting to upload a zip file named a57bze8931.zip. When attackers are successful at uploading the zip file, a single file named a57bze8931.php will be extracted into the /wp-content/uploads/kaswara/icons/ directory. The malicious file has an MD5 hash of d03c3095e33c7fe75acb8cddca230650. This file is an uploader under the control of the attacker. With this file, a malicious actor has the ability to continue uploading files to the compromised website.

The indicators observed in these attacks also include signs of the NDSW trojan, which injects code into otherwise legitimate JavaScript files and redirects site visitors to malicious websites. The presence of  this string in your JavaScript files is a strong indication that your site has been infected with NDSW:

;if(ndsw==

Some additional filenames that attackers are attempting to upload includes:

- [xxx]_young.zip where [xxx] varies and typically consists of 3 characters like ‘svv_young’
- inject.zip
- king_zip.zip
- null.zip
- plugin.zip
