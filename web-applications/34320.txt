jQuery < 3.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in html()

Timmy Willison recently released a new version of jQuery. jQuery 3.5 fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the jQuery’s HTML parser. The Snyk open source security platform estimates that 84% of all websites may be impacted by jQuery XSS vulnerabilities.

Masato Kinugawa found a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the htmlPrefilter method of jQuery, and published an example showing a popup alert window in the form of a challenge. (https://xss.pwnfunction.com/challenges/ww3/)

Below is a CodeQL query I wrote that can find user controlled values passed to html() which can be abused to perform Cross-Site Scripting.

Please check your projects, submit responsible disclosures to projects that might be affected.

```

 *              and generates a visualizable path from the source to the sink.
