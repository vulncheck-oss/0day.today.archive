title: WordPress Bookly Lite 13.2 Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability
author: Luigi Gubello
cves: 

In January I found a stored XSS in Bookly WP Plugin (10,000+ download for
Lite version on official WordPress plugin site and 18,000+ for Pro version
on CodeCanyon).

Link of Bookly stored XSS proof-of-concept:

During the booking phase, an unauthenticated user can inject arbitrary
code into the *Name* field of the plugin. The code will run in the admin
panel when an administrator checks the payments on the page
*bookly-payments*."
