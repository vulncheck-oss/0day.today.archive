WordPress (Optimized for Adsense)

# 2. Technical Description:
# WordPress Plugin Wp-Insert 2.4.2 and Before allows the attacker to upload
or transfer files of dangerous types
# that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.This
vulnerability is caused by FCKeditor
# in this plugin. Uploaded files represent a significant risk to
applications. The first step in many attacks is
# to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs
to find a way to get the code executed.
# Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.The
consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary,
# including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or
database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems,
# client-side attacks, or simple defacement. It depends on what the
application does with the uploaded file and especially
# where it is stored.
