Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Business Logic Bypass - Mail Relay (Post-authenticated)
- CVE CVE-2021-38130
- CWE-284: Improper Access Control
- CVSSv3: 5.4 (Medium)
https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N


Voltage SecureMail is an email protection service that provides email
encryption. With each secure email, there is an HTML attachment named
"message_zdm.html" that furnishes access to the Zero Download Messenger
(ZDM), which can be a web portal or mobile app. The encrypted body of
the original message as well as any attachments to the original email
is contained within this attachment.

The email recipient needs to install Voltage SecureMail app (for mobile) or
browse to the Voltage SecureMail Server portal (desktop) to authenticate and
view any secure email and attachments sent via ZDM.

When the recipient opens the "message_zdm.html" file for the first time
on a desktop, the browser is brought to the corporation's SecureMail
portal where the user has to create a password in order to continue.

An email verification email is sent to the recipient with a One Time Link,
and the recipient can read the email on the SecureMail portal after clicking
on the link.

If the recipient opens the "message_zdm.html" file again in the future,
the recipient has to input the previously created password.

When viewing the email on the SecureMail portal, the recipient can
choose to reply to the email by clicking "Reply" or "Reply to All".
The SecureMail portal only allows the recipient to reply to the
original email sender and to the email addresses in the Cc/Bcc list.
However, it is possible to modify the original email addresses in the
"to", "cc" or "bcc" fields, or to add arbitrary email addresses, by
sending a special POST request.

As the SecureMail portal displays the logo and valid SSL certificate of
the corporation in use, an attacker who have received a SecureMail encrypted
email previously can make use of the SecureMail portal to send phishing
emails to third parties. Note that the attacker is unable to spoof
the "from" address, so the emails to third parties will be from the
attacker's email address.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
When the recipient replies to the email by clicking "Reply" or "Reply to All", the
recipient is brought to the "Compose New Message" page. To send the email reply,
the recipient then clicks on the "Send Secure" button.

The SecureMail portal does not allow the modification of the "to", "cc" or
"bcc" field if the user attempts to intercept the POST request after
clicking on the "Send Secure" button.

However, if the user attempts to intercept the POST request after
clicking on the "Plain Text" button, the modification of the "to", "cc" or
"bcc" field is successful.

The modified email is then successfully sent out after the user
click on the "Send Secure" button.

It is noted that there is one difference in the POST request parameters
between a "Send Secure" and "Plain Text" that allows the "to", "cc" and
"bcc" fields to be modified, and the difference is the "send" versus "x"
parameters. The rest pf the contents of the "Send Secure" and "Plain Text"
POST requests are almost identical.
