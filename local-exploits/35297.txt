Title: Barco wePresent Hardcoded API Credentials
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-004.txt


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Barco
     Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
     Affected Version: 2.5.1.8, 2.5.0.25, 2.5.0.24, 2.4.1.19
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
     CVE ID: CVE-2020-28329


2. Vulnerability Description

     Barco wePresent device firmware includes a hardcoded API
     account and password that is discoverable by inspecting the
     firmware image. A malicious actor could use this password to
     access authenticated, administrative functions in the API.


3. Technical Description

     This vulnerability concerns the existence of default, hardcoded
     credentials that can be used to access an API service listening
     on port 4001/tcp.

     The password exists in clear text in /etc/lighthttp/admin and in
     a hashed form in etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.user. This information
     was obtained by downloading the firmware from wePresent's
     site and unpacking the firmware. URL for the firmware is
     https://www.barco.com/en/support/wepresent-wipg-1600W/drivers.
     Binwalk, with recursive scanning of extracted files, only
     partially unpacks the firmware. We devised a way to gracefully
     unpack the firmware using 'dd', see KL-001-2020-009 for
     further details.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (2.5.3.12) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:

7. Proof of Concept


     After unpacking the firmware:
     $ ls -al etc/lighttpd/admin
     -rwxr-xr-x 1 jbecher jbecher 36 Feb  6 23:42 etc/lighttpd/admin
     
     $ more etc/lighttpd/admin
