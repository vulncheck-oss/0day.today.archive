# Software Link: https://www.superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWARE
# Version: 10.0.1206 (lower versions are affected as well)
# Vulnerability Description
SUPERAntiSpyware Professional X Trial versions prior to 10.0.1206 are vulnerable to local privilege escalation because it allows unprivileged users to restore quarantined files to a privileged location through a NTFS directory junction.


# Proof of Concept
1. Place a dll payload in an empty folder
2. Scan the payload with the SUPERAntiSpyware Professional X Trial in order to get it detected.
3. Once it is detected and moved to quarantine, create a NTFS directory junction.
4. Restore the payload and reboot the system.
