[Vulnerability Type]
Security Bypass Protected Service Tampering


[CVE Reference]
CVE-2019-19697


[Security Issue]
Trend Micro Maximum Security is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution as it allows for creation of registry key to target a process running as SYSTEM.
This can allow a malware to gain elevated privileges to take over and shutdown services that require SYSTEM privileges like Trend Micros "Asmp"
service "coreServiceShell.exe" which does not allow Administrators to tamper with them.

This could allow an attacker or malware to gain elevated privileges and tamper with protected services by disabling or otherwise preventing them to start.
Note administrator privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

1) Create a entry for the following registry key targeting "PtWatchdog.exe" and set the debugger string value to an arbitrary executable to gain SYSTEM privs.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\PtWatchdog.exe

2) Create a string named "debugger" under the reg key and give it the value of the executable you wish to run as SYSTEM.

3) Restart the machine or wait until service is restart then you get SYSTEM and can now disable Trend Micro endpoint security coreServiceShell.exe service
