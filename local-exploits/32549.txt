# Exploit Title: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus 6.6 (Build < 6659) Privilege Escalation
# Exploit Author: Digital Interruption
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.manageengine.co.uk/
# Version: 6.6 (Build 6658)
# Tested on: Windows Server 2012 R2
# CVE : CVE-2018-19374

Due to weak permissions setup on the bin, lib and tools directories within the ManageEngine installation directory, it is possible for any authenticated user to modify several core files.

To escalate privileges to that of LOCAL SYSTEM, drop a payload onto the system and then add a line to bin\ChangeJRE.bat to execute it every time the system is rebooted.
