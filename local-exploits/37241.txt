Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to update the devices to the newest firmware listed
below, where, according to the vendor, the documented issue is fixed.

We want to thank Cisco for the very professional response and great coordination.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cleartext Storage of Phone Password
The phone is storing the "phone password", which is needed to access its
administrative settings, in cleartext (in multiple locations) in the flash
memory.

Because the password is not hashed using a suitable cryptographic hash function
and the storage is unencrypted, a physical attacker can easily recover the
password and reuse it on other phones, if they are not configured to use unique
administrative passwords.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cleartext Storage of Phone Password
Steps to take:
- Configure a phone password via the TFTP XML provisioning feature.
- Desoldering the memory and reading its content.
- Analyzing the memory content. As example, the Linux command 'strings' can be
   used below to show the identified password in cleartext in the dumped data.
   ----------------------------------------
   $ strings nand.dump | grep phonePassword
   phonePassword>sectest</,x
   phonePassword>sectest</,x
   phonePassword>sectest</,x
   phonePassword>sectest</,x
   ----------------------------------------
